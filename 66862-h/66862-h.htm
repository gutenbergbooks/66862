<p class="drop-cap">THE great alienist sat down at
his desk, and having emptied
his mind of all other impressions,
held it up like a dipper for his
new patient to fill. Large, blond,
and handsome, she was plainly accustomed
to being listened to. Before
she had fairly undone her furs
and folded her hands within her
muff, the doctor&#8217;s lateral vision had
told him that, whatever her problems,
it was not about her own nervous
system that she had come to
consult him.</p>

<p>Not too quickly her story began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
to take shape. Her household, her
husband, her four children&mdash;three
small boys and an older daughter, a
girl of seventeen....</p>

<p>&#8220;My only thought has been my
children, Dr. Despard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your <i>only</i> thought, Mrs. Royce?&#8221;</p>

<p>She assented. The daughter was
the problem&mdash;the daughter of seventeen.</p>

<p>&#8220;She and I have been such friends;
I have always been a friend to my
children, I hope, as well as a parent.
And Celia&#8217;s little arrangements, her
clothes and her small parties, have
been as much my interests as hers&mdash;more,
perhaps. The bond between
us has been peculiarly close until
the last year or so. Lately a rebellious
spirit has begun to develop. I
have tried to make allowances, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
naturally there are certain questions
of manners and deportment&mdash;small
but important&mdash;about which
one cannot yield. I am almost
ashamed to confess how unaffectionate
are the terms that we have
reached. The situation will strike
you as a strange one between a
mother and daughter&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook his head. &#8220;You are by
no means the only mother and
daughter whose relations are unsatisfactory.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, the young people of to-day!&#8221;
she sighed. &#8220;What <i>is</i> the matter
with them, with the age, Dr. Despard?
They are so hard, so individualistic.
I myself was one of a large
family, and we lived in the house
with my grandparents and aunts.
My life was made up of little duties<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
for older people&mdash;duties I never
thought of questioning. They were
a pleasure to me. But if I ask Celia
to go on an errand for me&mdash;or even
to attend to something for herself&mdash;I
am met by the look of a martyr
or a rebel. But that is not the worst.
At times, Dr. Despard, her language
to me is violent&mdash;is&mdash;actually profane.
I cannot help looking on this
as an abnormal manifestation. At
last I saw her case was pathological.
No nice girl swears at her mother,
and&#8221;&mdash;Mrs. Royce smiled&mdash;&#8220;my
daughter is a nice girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>It seemed to him that Mrs. Royce
must be a very nice mother indeed.
Soft, serious, and eminently maternal,
she appealed profoundly to all
his bachelor ideals.</p>

<p>&#8220;And your husband?&#8221; he asked.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
&#8220;How does he get on with his
daughter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Admirably,&#8221; she returned warmly;
&#8220;they hardly see each other.&#8221;</p>

<p>He glanced quickly at her to see
if her intention were humorous, but
something mechanical in her smile
had already warned him that her
mind was bent on other of life&#8217;s aspects
than the comic. Now she was
quite serious, and he replied with
equal gravity:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is often the solution.&#8221;</p>

<p>They decided, at length, that he
was to spend a few days with them
in the country. To bring the girl to
his office would be useless. He would
find her a gentle, well-behaved little
creature, perhaps too much interested
in her books. The exigencies
of the children&#8217;s education kept the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
Royces in town during the week, but
they spent Saturday and Sunday at
the old Royce place on the Hudson.
Here Despard promised to come at
the first opportunity.</p>

<p>She thanked him, and held out a
strong, firm hand.</p>

<p>No, he thought when she had gone,
he could not understand a girl&#8217;s
swearing at such a mother&mdash;at once
so affectionate and so intelligent, for,
with pardonable egotism, Despard
reckoned her bringing the problem
to him a proof of rare domestic intelligence.
Most women would have
made it the subject of anger or
tears.</p>

<p>He himself held no special brief
for youth. The younger generation
did not attract him. His own nephews
and nieces never made him return
disgusted to his loneliness, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
rather raised his enjoyment of his
solitude.</p>

<p>Before he admitted his next patient
he stood a moment contemplating
the sacrifices made by a parent.
&#8220;It&#8217;s stupendous, it&#8217;s too much,&#8221;
he thought; and smiled to think
that, if he had married, a child of
his might now be conducting him to
a doctor&#8217;s office, for of the two he
would undoubtedly have been the
first to swear.</p>

<p>After a week particularly crowded
with the concerns of other people
Despard arrived, at high noon of a
day in early April, at the Royces&#8217;
place. Never, he thought, had he
seen peace so clearly embodied. A
dense, fresh lawn sloped down to
the hazy river; splendid old trees
were everywhere; the serious stone
house had been built with the simple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
notions of comfort that existed
a hundred years ago.</p>

<p>Mr. Royce, who met him at the
station, seemed a peaceful sort of
person, too&mdash;a man whose forebears
had been more like fairy god-parents
than ordinary ancestors, for
they had given him a handsome,
healthy body, a fair fortune, a respected
name, and, best of all, an
unquestioning belief in all the institutions
of his own time, such as
matrimony, the ten commandments,
and the blessings of paternity.</p>

<p>Despard turned the conversation
toward the daughter, but was soon
aware that he was getting a mere
echo of Mrs. Royce&#8217;s opinions.</p>

<p>&#8220;The child has worked herself into
an abnormal frame of mind,&#8221; said
her father.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>&#8220;You draw this from your own
observations?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, more from her mother&#8217;s.
I leave that sort of thing to my wife.
She has great cares, great responsibilities.
She takes life almost too
seriously.&#8221; He sighed. The next instant
his face lighted up in pointing
out to Despard a giant chestnut-tree
just saved from a blighting disease.
For a few minutes he spoke
on the subject with extraordinary
vividness.</p>

<p>Despard was quick to recognize
expert knowledge, and Royce, with
something approaching a blush, admitted
that he did understand the
care of native trees. &#8220;I have sometimes
thought of writing a book
about it,&#8221; he said timidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You certainly should.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>&#8220;Ah, it&#8217;s so difficult to find time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Despard smiled. Who had leisure
if this favored being had not? He
himself, without one hour in the
twenty-four that he could call his
own, was already at work on his
third.</p>

<p>He met the whole family assembled
at luncheon: a pale German
governess, three little boys, and the
dark-eyed Celia, sweet-mouthed but
sullen-browed.</p>

<p>Despard, who had had no breakfast,
thought more than he would
have confessed about the victuals
set before him. Any family ought
to be amiable, he thought, on food
at once so simple and delicious.
His opinion of Mrs. Royce rose still
higher.</p>

<p>Within the next hour he came to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
the conclusion that, in spite of his
extended knowledge of American
interiors, he had never before been
in a really well-appointed house&mdash;a
house, that is, where one wise and
affectionate person directed every
detail. Mrs. Royce, he found, knew
every aspect of her home. She not
only knew her flowers almost as
individuals, but she knew the vase
and the place where each appeared
to the best advantage. She knew
better than her husband which chair
he liked, where he kept his cigars,
and which little table would be best
at his elbow. Nor was her consideration
confined to her own family.
She had thought of a tired doctor&#8217;s
special needs. She had given him
&#8220;a little room, where he could be
quiet and get a glimpse of the river.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>Shut in this room, not so very
little after all, he walked to the writing-table
to make a memorandum.
It had more than once happened
to him to find, in a house accounted
luxurious, only a dry, encrusted
inkstand in the spare room. Not so
here. Never was ink so fluidly,
greenly new; never was blotting-paper
so eagerly absorbent. He noticed,
besides three sizes of paper
and envelopes, that there were cable
blanks, telegraph blanks, and
postal cards, as well as stamps of
all varieties.</p>

<p>It was not Despard&#8217;s habit to notice
life quite as much in detail as
this, but now it amused him to pursue
the subject. Luxury he knew;
but this effective consideration he
rated as something higher.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">II</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">HE had arrived on a Friday, and
on Sunday at five&mdash;things
were apt to happen by a
schedule in the Royce household&mdash;he
was to give his report on Celia.</p>

<p>He entered the library&mdash;the spot
designated by Mrs. Royce&mdash;by one
door as Churchley, the butler, came
in at the other to serve tea.</p>

<p>The dark, shining little table was
brought out, noiselessly opened, covered
with a cloth&mdash;the wrong cloth,
Mrs. Royce indicated. Churchley
whisked away and returned incredibly
quickly with the right one.
The tray, weighted with silver and
blossoming with the saffron flame<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
of the tea-kettle, was next put before
her, and then another little
structure of shelves was set at her
right hand. Her eye fell on this.</p>

<p>&#8220;I said <i>brown</i>-bread toast, Churchley.&#8221;
The man murmured and again
whisked away.</p>

<p>All this time Despard had not sat
down, although between orders Mrs.
Royce had more than once urged him
to do so. He stood, having shut the
door behind him, leaning the point
of his shoulder against the wall.</p>

<p>Utterly undisturbed by his calm
eyes fixed upon her, Mrs. Royce
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Churchley, he has been with
us for six years, but I&#8217;m afraid I
can&#8217;t keep him. He forgets everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s on the edge of a nervous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
breakdown,&#8221; answered Despard
coolly, and he added: &#8220;The housemaid
is a pronounced neurasthenic.
As for your daughter&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Celia, poor, dear child! Must
we send her away?&#8221; her mother
asked, but before the doctor had
time to answer, Churchley, by a
miracle of celerity, again entered,
this time bearing toast of the desired
complexion.</p>

<p>After he had finally disappeared,
Mrs. Royce busied herself with flame
and kettle and tea-caddy before she
repeated her question, and her voice
had in it a faint sediment of these
preoccupations:</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you do not think it necessary
to send Celia away, Dr. Despard?&#8221;</p>

<p>He drew a chair forward and sat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
down. &#8220;No, Mrs. Royce,&#8221; he said;
&#8220;I think it necessary to send you
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Me?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>He bowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;But my health is excellent. Oh,
I see,&#8221; she smiled. &#8220;My husband
has been talking to you about my
responsibilities. Yes, they are great,
but one is given strength to do what
is required of one. I shall not have
to desert my post. I am strong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you are strong, Mrs.
Royce,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but you are the
cause of weakness in others. We
need not multiply examples: your
daughter, the governess, Churchley&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She broke in&mdash;&#8220;Of course, I admit
their weakness. But don&#8217;t you see
how I protect and support them?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
How could you imagine that I was
the cause?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it suggestive that practically
every one with whom you come
in contact&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My husband,&#8221; she retorted, quoting
an instance against him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your husband has great natural
calm, and spends eight hours a day
out of the house. You have made
this home, this really wonderful
home, for those you love. No one
admires the achievement more than
I do. But you have sacrificed too
much of yourself in doing it; and
I&#8217;m not speaking of your physical
strength. In this library, in which
you are so fond of sitting, how many
books have you ever read?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was a great reader as a girl,&#8221;
she answered.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>&#8220;Which of these have you read in
the last ten years?&#8221;</p>

<p>She murmured that he perhaps
hardly understood the demands upon
her time.</p>

<p>&#8220;You never read. You can&#8217;t,&#8221; he
returned. &#8220;Since my first hour
here I have been watching you, not
your daughter. Her case is simple
enough. You don&#8217;t read, Mrs. Royce,
not because you have no time, but
because you have no concentration.
This is one of the many sacrifices
you have made to your household&mdash;a
serious one, and we must face
the results. I have watched you each
day carrying the morning papers
about with you until evening, and
then, if you read the headlines, it
is as much as you can accomplish.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had been staring at him as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
though in a trance, but now she
came to, with a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Dr. Despard,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;if you were the mother of four
children and the head&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He held up his hand. &#8220;You must
let me finish,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You have
made this home, and you administer
it with consummate ability; and
yet no one is really happy in it,
least of all yourself. Why? Well, I
need not remind you that no one is
made happy merely by things. Some
continuity of inner life is absolutely
necessary, not only to happiness
but to health. Remember, I am
speaking as a nerve specialist. You,
Mrs. Royce, are an enemy to continuity.
You dispel concentration as
a rock dispels a wave. Even I find
no little difficulty, when in your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
presence, in pursuing a consecutive
train of thought, and, as for you
yourself, such a thing has long been
impossible for you. Even now, on
this matter so immensely important
to you, you have not been able to
give me your undivided attention.
Other facts have kept coming up in
your consciousness&mdash;that a bell rang
somewhere; that the hearth has not
been swept up. Acutely aware as I
am of your point of view, these
breaks in your attention have been
breaks in mine, too; but I have been
able to overcome them, and follow
my ideas to the end, because I have
been trained to do so, and, besides,
I&#8217;ve been here only two days. In
two days more I would not answer
for myself. I should begin to see
things, things, things, and to believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
that all life was merely a question
of arrangements. Even your religion,
Mrs. Royce, in which most
people find some continuity, is a question
of things&mdash;of Sunday-schools and
altar decoration. That poor little
clergyman who lunched here to-day&mdash;he
came emanating a certain spiritual
peace; but he went away crushed
by your poor opinion of him as an executive.
At this moment he is probably
breaking up the current of his
life by a conscientious attention to
things.&#8221;</p>

<p>Deeply protesting as she was in
her heart, something in his hard,
clear look kept her silent, and he
went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;Your daughter is&mdash;to use a big
word&mdash;an intellectual. For the time
being she is interested only in things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
of the mind. New ideas, books, poetry
are the great adventures of life
to her at present. To all this you
are an obstructionist&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There, at least, you are utterly
at fault,&#8221; cried the poor lady, with
a passion she had not known for
years. &#8220;I have done everything in
my power to help. I am very ambitious
in regard to my children&#8217;s education.
Their schools, their teachers&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; said Despard, &#8220;you have
set out the counters for them but
you have never let them play the
game. You were interested in making
the arrangements, but you had no
interest at all in the state of mind
which could take advantage of them.
Your daughter knows, not only that
you take no thought for such matters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
yourself, but that every phase
of your contact with her demands
her attention for other matters&mdash;clothes,
manners, hours, and dates.
You have no respect for her preoccupations.
Not once, not twice, but
fifty times a day, you interrupt her,
with a caress, or an errand, or more
often a reproof. Yesterday, when she
was obviously absorbed in reading
that bit of verse to her father, you
sent her up-stairs to change her
shoes&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They were wet; she would have
caught cold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you had listened you would
have seen she had only four more
lines to read. You do all this, not
only when she is in your domain, at
meals and in the drawing-room, but
you follow her to her own room and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
go in without knocking. I venture to
say that that child works at night,
for the simple reason that to work
in this house during the daytime is
impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really,&#8221; said Mrs. Royce, &#8220;with
the best will in the world I do not
understand you. Celia&#8217;s friends sometimes
seem to feel that I ought to
neglect her manners and pronunciation,
ought to allow her to become
selfish and self-centred, so
that she may&mdash;&#8221; She broke off as
if words failed her. &#8220;But I have
never heard a grown person suggest
that such a course would be right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask your clergyman what is
right,&#8221; answered Despard. &#8220;I am
here to tell you what is healthy; I
am here to prescribe. Now, notice,
please, I do not tell you to change.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
I don&#8217;t think you could. The reactions
have taken place too many
times. I tell you to go away. We
can call it a rest cure. You shall have
beautiful surroundings, comfort, and,
above all that leisure that recent
years have failed to give you. In
return I shall ask you to concentrate
your mind for a certain number
of hours each day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You talk,&#8221; she cried bitterly, &#8220;as
if I enjoyed the treadmill of my daily
life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have unusual executive ability,
and most of us enjoy the use of
our powers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The best refutation of all that
you have said is that I am eager to
go,&#8221; she returned. &#8220;Ah, I cannot
tell you how inviting such a prospect
seems to me&mdash;not to order dinner,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
not to have to decide and arrange for
every one, not to be the pivot of the
whole structure. Ah, Dr. Despard,
I would so gladly go, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what would happen to my
family without me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They must try looking out for
themselves,&#8221; he answered. He glanced
at his watch, for he was to take a
train that afternoon; and Mrs. Royce
collected herself enough to touch the
bell&mdash;it always hung within tempting
reach of her hand&mdash;and gave Churchley
orders to send for the motor and
have the doctor&#8217;s bags brought down.</p>

<p>During this interval Despard walked
to the window and stood looking out.
It is not always so easy to apply the
knife psychologically as physically.
He wondered if he could have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
more gentle and equally effective.
As he stood there Celia came sauntering
across the lawn, her head bent,
her hands deep in the pockets of an
enveloping dun-colored coat. The
brow which had first seemed sulky to
him appeared now simply thoughtful.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">III</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE strength of Mrs. Royce&#8217;s
character was shown by the
fact that she obeyed&mdash;she actually
went. She went almost gladly&mdash;a
state of mind induced by the extraordinary
activity of her last days
at home. In one brilliant flash of
prophecy and power she foresaw
and forestalled every contingency
that could arise in her absence. She
departed in a condition of exhaustion
fully justifying the doctor&#8217;s story of
a needed rest.</p>

<p>Her weariness lasted through the
first few days at the sanatorium. She
was well content to lie in bed and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
think of nothing. But by the fifth or
sixth day she began to wonder where
she had left the key of the cedar
closet; and several possibilities of
error in the arrangements she had
made to reach from garret to cellar
began to creep into her consciousness.
Her elder boy was subject to throat
trouble; her younger was subtly
averse to bathing. She had not, perhaps,
sufficiently emphasized these
two dangers. She had, however,
given her promise not to communicate
with her household except in
case of necessity.</p>

<p>Conscientious in her determination
to do what she had set out to do, she
took out some of the books she had
brought with her, but they seemed an
unsatisfactory lot: the novels, trashy;
the essays, dull; the history, heavy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
Strange, she thought, how people will
recommend books which really did
not even hold one&#8217;s attention.</p>

<p>The word attention, bringing with it
the recollection of Despard&#8217;s speech,
recalled her to her obligations. Heavy
or not, she was resolved to make her
way through the volume.</p>

<p>She read: &#8220;It has been argued that
the too rapid introduction of modern
political machinery, and the too
rapid unification of such different
populations as those&mdash;&#8221; Had she
told them not to keep the house
too hot in these first spring days?
Overheated houses, in her opinion,
were a fruitful source of ill health.
&#8220;&mdash;though these may with more
justice be ascribed to deep-seated
sociological causes stretching back
through two thousand years&mdash;&#8221; This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
was the season for putting away the
furs. If, in her absence, moths should
attack her husband&#8217;s sable-lined overcoat!
Ah, she put down her book;
this was serious.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later she went out,
trying to walk off the haunting presence
of that fur coat.</p>

<p>There was something not a little
heroic in her struggle with temptations&mdash;staying
on while every notion
she had heretofore considered righteous
called to her to go back. Hideous
pictures of ruin and discomfort
at home floated before her mind.
She had to admit she found a certain
grim satisfaction in such visions.
They would at least prove to Despard
how little the modern family is
able to dispense with the services of
the old-fashioned mother.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>She was human enough to be eager
to prove him wrong in essentials, for
in minor matters he had shown himself
terribly accurate. With unlimited
leisure on her hands she was surprised
to find how little enjoyment she derived
from her books. She read herself
to sleep with a novel every night,
but it was enough for her to open one
of the more serious works for her
mind to rush back to the old domestic
problems. Her eyes alone would
read the printed page.</p>

<p>Her life seemed hideously vacant&mdash;empty,
as she put it, of all affection;
but it was also empty of all machinery&mdash;perhaps
the greater change of
the two. She had no small duties,
no orders to give, no mistakes to
correct.</p>

<p>She was not forbidden to communicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
with Despard, and at the end of
a week she telegraphed him that she
was going home. He came to her at
once.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am doing what I know to be
wrong,&#8221; she broke out. &#8220;I am neglecting
my family.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are doing what your medical
adviser orders.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;but can you
guarantee that nothing will happen
in my absence? Will it be any comfort
to me, if things go wrong, to say
that I was obeying orders?&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not directly answer this
question, which had been largely
rhetorical in intention. Instead, he
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose you are dreadfully
bored.&#8221;</p>

<p>She checked an impulse toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
complete denial. He had stated half
the truth. She was bored, but she
tried to make him see that there was
more than that in her attitude. He,
a man and a bachelor, could hardly
realize how serious might be the results
of a mother&#8217;s protracted absence.</p>

<p>He had at times a trick&mdash;irritating
to Mrs. Royce&mdash;of replying to
something slightly different from the
thought one had expressed. He did
so now.</p>

<p>&#8220;And if they do miss you,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;won&#8217;t that be a help?&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes, certainly, it would be a help,
and it was perhaps that thought
which kept her on day after day&mdash;the
thought that they were missing
her in every detail of life, the belief
that the daily service, the common-place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
sacrifice of an existence like
hers could only be realized by its
cessation.</p>

<p>One reward she had. Her books
began to grow more interesting. &#8220;It
grows better as you get into it,&#8221; she
explained to one of the nurses, but in
her heart she knew the improvement
was not in the book.</p>

<p>At last a night came when she had a
dream, more poignant, more vivid
than any material message could
have been&mdash;a dream of disaster at
home. She was not a superstitious
woman, but the impression already
in her mind was immensely deepened.
She was needed at home; that
was her place. What madness it had
been for her to go away, and what a
selfish madness, made up partly of
desire to rest and partly of a wish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
to prove Despard wrong! She might
have cause to reproach herself for the
remainder of her life. She could forgive
him all that she herself had suffered,
removed from her work, deprived
of all occupation and happy
home activities, but if anything had
gone wrong with those she loved&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>That very afternoon she went
home.</p>

<p>Once inside her own gates she began
to see signs of her three weeks&#8217;
absence. Although the grounds were
nominally her husband&#8217;s charge, the
standards since her departure had
evidently been lowered. The gutters
were but half cleared and the gravel
unraked. The appearance of the
house confirmed her fears. The window
curtains had not been changed.
Sixty-two dirty window curtains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
seemed to her to offer but a dreary
welcome.</p>

<p>In spite of sunshine, the rainy-day
door mat greeted her, left from the
day before, which had been rainy;
and the brasses of the door, though
not actually tarnished, lacked that
elysian brightness on which she herself
insisted.</p>

<p>As she mounted the steps two of the
boys came running up&mdash;hugging and
clawing at her with hands on which
she caught a glimpse of the lustrous
veneer of dirt. They were so glad to
see her; and little Lewis had been ill.
Her heart stood still&mdash;oh, only a cold.
Where was he? she asked them, and
when they said&mdash;oh, horror!&mdash;out
with the governess in the pony cart,
she sent them racing after him.</p>

<p>The darkest forebodings filled her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
mind as to what she would find
within. She rang and, after an interval
too long by several minutes,
Churchley opened the door. For an
instant his appearance drove all
other thoughts away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Churchley,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;you
have been putting on weight!&#8221;</p>

<p>Churchley acknowledged the imputation
with a smile that approached
dangerously near a dimple.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, madame,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve
taken a great turn for the better,&#8221;
and he asked sympathetically after
her own health.</p>

<p>She made no answer, but, turning
her head away from the staircase, in
whose crevices she had already detected
faint gray lines of dust, she
moved toward the library door, which
Churchley quietly opened for her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>She saw with a shock that the arrangement
of the furniture&mdash;an arrangement
sanctified by twenty years
of habit&mdash;had been altered. Two
desks had been drawn near the windows
without any respect for symmetry,
and at these, back to back,
her husband and daughter were
sitting.</p>

<p>That Celia should bring her school-books
to the library, though unusual,
was not unnatural, but the
sight of Royce at work on page after
page of foolscap was something requiring
an explanation.</p>

<p>The room was perfectly quiet except
for the scratch of his pen and
the ticking of the clock; and Mrs.
Royce decided that she would stand
there silent until some other interruption
occurred. It could not be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
very long before a servant entered
or they themselves would weary of
this work.</p>

<p>But the silence continued. Once
Royce took out a book and glanced
at some reference. Once Celia got
up and lighted the lamps for both,
but neither of them spoke.</p>

<p>For a long time Mrs. Royce stood
there, transfixed by a curious conviction
that came to her as she
watched&mdash;the conviction that this
silence carried with it a more perfect
companionship than all her long
talks with her husband had ever
brought. Of course, she had long
since realized that, as gradually as
one season melts into another, her
relationship to her husband had
changed&mdash;changed inevitably, she
had imagined, from the poetry of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
first love into something that resembled
the prose of a business partnership.
To her the change was not
altogether to be regretted; in her
eyes the business of being the head
of a man&#8217;s house and the mother of
his children was still charged with
the romantic idea. But for the first
time it now occurred to her to ask
whether the change had been equally
satisfactory to him. Ah, she admitted
that a certain charm, a certain
stimulation had gone from their
affection, but never before had she
thought, as she was thinking now,
that the quality most conspicuously
absent was intimacy. How was such
a thing possible when she had lived
twenty years of her life with him in
perfect amity?</p>

<p>Yet, standing there, she saw that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
for many years she had not had the
least conception of what had been
going on in his mind. She had used
the word business partnership, and,
naturally, when they were together
they often discussed the details of
the business, only now she remembered
that it was always in <i>her</i> department
that the problems for discussion
arose. Royce seemed to be
able to manage his end of it without
consultation. Why was this?</p>

<p>She tried desperately to see the
thing clearly. Her whole life was
built on the belief that she existed
solely to be depended upon; and
yet she saw that her husband, in all
his more personal interests, far from
depending on her, never even mentioned
them to her. What did that
mean? And why had she never observed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
this contradiction before?
Could it be that, after all, she was
not dependable, or had some unreckoned
factor in his life rendered
Royce more self-reliant than he had
been in the early days of their marriage?</p>

<p>And at this point, before she realized
her intention, she heard her
own voice saying: &#8220;Celia, my dear,
your lamp is flaring.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, there was no question of the
welcome with which both pairs of
eyes lit up. &#8220;Mother, <i>dear</i>!&#8221; cried
the girl. Both overwhelmed her with
solicitude about her health. She did
not have to ask after theirs. Never
were two rosier, more unlined faces
than theirs.</p>

<p>After a moment she asked what it
was that her husband was writing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
and he answered, almost timidly,
that it was a book on trees; he had
had the idea in his mind for a number
of years but had never had the
energy to begin it before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; she asked almost
sharply, but before he had time to
answer&mdash;and it was evident he himself
had no idea of the real answer&mdash;Celia
broke in:</p>

<p>&#8220;And what do you think, mother?
I&#8217;ve won the prize for composition
at school. I had the idea the very
night you went away, and I&#8217;ve
worked and worked over it, and they
all say that it is much better than
anything I ever did before. Aren&#8217;t
you glad?&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes, her mother was glad, but a
strain of bitterness mingled with her
rejoicing. Was it, indeed, her absence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
that had released all the vital
energy?</p>

<p>One hope lingered unacknowledged
in her breast. She turned to her
husband.</p>

<p>&#8220;And have they made you comfortable
since I went?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, perfectly,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Everything
has gone without a hitch,
thanks to your arrangements.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Celia chimed in, &#8220;the servants
have been too wonderful;
they&#8217;ve done everything just as if
you were at home, only better.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Royce looked round the room,
where to her eye everything was
wrong&mdash;the corners dusty, the lamps
ill-cared for, the sofa pillows rumpled,
and the tea-tray, which ought
to have been removed, still standing
disordered in a corner.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>She stretched her hand toward the
bell to ring and order it taken away;
and then, checking herself, she sank
back and folded her hands idly in
her lap. Her husband had begun to
tell her something about his book.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
